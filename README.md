# Notes

- I don't really feel for others and their plights like ever but I have strong feelings about not having those feelings
- I need to start paying attention to my emotions, but I don't know what they are telling me
- I am worried I will attempt to listen and interpret them but be wrong because I've been wrong before. 
- Maybe it is just depression that comes and goes and really kicks off sometimes when I take adderall 
- I am pretty sure I should see a therepist or something. Counseler? Not sure. 
  - I believe I need to start paying attention to my body on a lot of levels disregarding mental 
    - physical: working out, getting stronger for a healthier me, eating healthier. Maybe a personal trainer and dietetician? 
    - Emotional: figure out my emotions. Don't be scared of them and really try out things. I will fuck up but that's fine. Maybe counseler or therepist? 
    - For the therepist, I worry that it's more about how to fit in and be normal and that's not what I want. I just don't want to be miserable. 
    - For the personal trainer, I am not a fan of lifting but I love dance. Maybe do dance instead? Other options?
